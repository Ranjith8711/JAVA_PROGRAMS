# 🚀 Java Programming 

This repository serves as a structured collection of fundamental to intermediate Java programs, focusing on essential concepts like number properties, string manipulation, control flow, and basic application logic. It's a great resource for learning, practicing, and reviewing core Java skills.

## 🎯 Repository Goals

* **Foundation:** Solidify understanding of Java syntax and control structures (loops, conditionals).
* **Algorithms:** Implement common algorithms related to numbers (prime, factorial, GCD, LCM) and strings (palindrome).
* **Problem-Solving:** Tackle practical exercises and mini-projects.

These programs focus on analyzing and manipulating integer data.

| # | Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Palindrome in Int** | Check if an integer is the same when reversed. |
| **2** | **Perfect Number** | Find a number where the sum of its proper divisors equals the number itself. |
| **3** | **Perfect Square Number** | Determine if a number is a perfect square. |
| **4** | **Factorial Number / Fact Number** | Calculate the factorial (product of all positive integers less than or equal to) of a number. |
| **5** | **Prime** | Check if a number is a prime number (divisible only by 1 and itself). |
| **6** | **Average Number** | Calculate the average of a set of numbers. |
| **7** | **Buzz Number** | Check if a number is divisible by 7 or ends with 7. |
| **8** | **Duck Number** | Check if a number contains the digit zero (excluding leading zeros). |
| **9** | **Largest Number** | Find the largest among a set of numbers (e.g., two or three). |
| **10** | **Reverse Number** | Reverse the digits of an integer. |
| **11** | **Strong Number** | Check if the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to the original number. |
| **12** | **LCM & GCD** | Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) and Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers. |
| **13** | **Ugly Number** | Check if a number's prime factors are only 2, 3, or 5. |
| **14** | **Magic Number** | Check if the iterative sum of a number's digits eventually results in 1 (e.g., 19: 1+9=10, 1+0=1). |
| **15** | **Twin Prime Number** | Find pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2 (e.g., (3, 5), (5, 7)). |
| **16** | **Pornic Number** | *(Note: This seems to be a custom or non-standard term. Clarification/Correction needed, or implement based on local definition.)* |
| **17** | **Weird Number Check** | *(Note: Implement based on the definition of a "Weird Number" in mathematics - an abundant number that is not semiperfect.)* |

### ⚙️ Digits, Loops & Math

Programs focused on digit manipulation and essential utility functions.

| # | Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **18** | **Digit Counter / Math Function using to Digits Count** | Count the number of digits in an integer, potentially using the `Math` library (e.g., `Math.log10`). |
| **19** | **Number < 10 Check** | Simple conditional check if a number is less than 10. |
| **20** | **Unique Number** | Check if all digits in a number are distinct. |
| **21** | **Sum of Positive Number** | Calculate the sum of all positive numbers entered by the user. |
| **22** | **Multiply Of Digit** | Calculate the product of the digits of a number. |
| **23** | **Odd Number / 1 to 100 Odd/Even** | Check if a number is odd, and generate/print odd/even numbers in a range (1 to 100). |
| **24** | **Return Statement** | Demonstrate the use of the `return` keyword in methods. |

### 📜 Strings & Characters

Programs involving text and character array manipulation.

| # | Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **25** | **Palindrome in String** | Check if a string reads the same forwards and backwards. |
| **26** | **Vowels in Remove in String** | Create a new string with all vowels removed from the original string. |
| **27** | **Adding Number for String** | Extract and sum all numerical digits found within a string. |
| **28** | **Character Movement** | *(Note: Potentially involves shifting characters, like a simple Caesar cipher or string rotation.)* |

### 🌳 Control Flow & Structure

These exercises demonstrate essential flow control mechanisms in Java.

| # | Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **29** | **Break Statement / Outer Break / Nested Loop Break** | Demonstrate the use of `break` within standard and labeled nested loops. |
| **30** | **Continue Statement** | Demonstrate the use of `continue` to skip the rest of the loop's body. |
| **31** | **Pattern / Pattern Printing** | Implement various types of pattern printing using nested loops (e.g., stars, numbers, shapes). |
| **32** | **Choice Selection** | Implement a menu-driven program using `switch` statements or nested `if-else` blocks. |

### ⏰ Date & Time / Practical Logic
